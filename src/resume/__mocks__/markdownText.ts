As IBM contractor company we developed internal applications for IBM sales and customer fulfillment department using Java EE for backend 
and jQuery and/orDojo for front-end. The projects involved the translation of the business process to web components that helped the user to 
perform their tasks in a better way. One sample of the applications I was the main contributor was the IBM BIG BLUE QUEUE (BBQ). It was a 
project that was composed of three parts:\n\n
1. An Eclipse plugin for LotusNotes 8.5 or higher (JAVA SWT).\n
2. A Java EE Web application serving as a kind of requests hub, built with the EMERGYS Web-frame 4 (Java EE web framework).\n
3. A web API (built with Java EE using JAX-RS and WSDL) to be consumed/ingested to manage the request in the hub.\n
