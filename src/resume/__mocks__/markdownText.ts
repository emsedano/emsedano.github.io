- Reduced 20% costs and 50% render time of application by splitting and relocating the application in different micro-service sso we focused costs on resources with high computation.\n
- Reduced development time by creating of configurable multi-layered React JS charts components consuming a Spring boot APIs with MyBatis for dynamic queries construction and common output responses.\n
- Projects totally mounted in a cloud architecture deployed in IBM Cloud (cloud foundry)Key developer and architecture contributor.\n

As a nearshore company, we were a team extension for an Important American bank, we develop web application experiences using several 
frameworks like Spring, apache wicket and others (using mostly JavaEE 6+) running on clustered IBM WebSphere Application Servers environments.
Domain application are related to real estate,credit cards and more.


Spree Commerce implementations (Llantiprecio, Ingredienta & [ePinturas](https://www.epinturas.com.mx)). Spree commerce is a Ruby on Rails open source e-commerce framework, 
these applications were capable of user authentication, registration, password recovery, account and products management, cart and checkout process. We developed extra features 
like ERP sync (products & purchases). All implementations were complemented with AngularJS applications.\n

As IBM contractor company we developed internal applications for IBM sales and customer fulfillment department using Java EE for backend 
and jQuery and/orDojo for front-end. The projects involved the translation of the business process to web components that helped the user to 
perform their tasks in a better way. One sample of the applications I was the main contributor was the IBM BIG BLUE QUEUE (BBQ). It was a 
project that was composed of three parts:\n\n
1. An Eclipse plugin for LotusNotes 8.5 or higher (JAVA SWT).\n
2. A Java EE Web application serving as a kind of requests hub, built with the EMERGYS Web-frame 4 (Java EE web framework).\n
3. A web API (built with Java EE using JAX-RS and WSDL) to be consumed/ingested to manage the request in the hub.\n
